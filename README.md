# Zillow ETL and Analysis

## Description

Data Engineering and Analysis project.\
Ingested, transformed, and loaded data from Zillow's real estate API into an ETL pipeline using various Azure services including Azure Databricks, Delta Lake, and Azure Data Factory (ADF).

Created a production pipeline, cleaned raw historical and current market data, and analyzed potential return on investment (ROI) trends that each region/city would yield.

## Design

- Built a production level architecture for a Data Engineering solution using Azure Databricks for data cleaning, Azure Data Lake Gen2 for blob storage, and Azure Data Factory for orchestrating the ETL pipeline

- Created, configured, and monitored Databricks clusters, cluster pools, and jobs

- Mounted Azure Storage in Databricks using secrets stored in Azure Key Vault

- Created dashboards to visualise the outputs

- PySpark for Ingestion of CSV files into the data lake (ADLS) as delta files/ tables and Transformed for SQL analysis.

- Spark SQL for creating databases, tables, and transformations such as Filter, Join, Simple Aggregations, GroupBy, Window functions, etc.

- **Implemented Full Refresh and Incremental Load patterns using Partitions and ADLS Delta Lake**

- Used both PySpark as well as Spark SQL for Reading, Writing, Updating, Deleting and Merging data to Delta Lake

- Utilized History, Time Travel, and Vacuum

- Converted Parquet files to Delta files

- Created pipelines to execute Databricks notebooks

- Designed robust pipelines to deal with unexpected scenarios such as missing files

- Migrated Databricks CSV tables over to Azure SQL database for user-facing queries

- Hosted simple Flask application for viewing data reports and some exploratory analsyis through Azure SQL Server
